**Senior C++/Qt Developer | Expert in 3D Development & Legacy Code Modernization**

I'm a passionate developer with 19 years of international experience building complex, cross-platform desktop applications. My core expertise lies in modern C++, the Qt framework, and 3D applications. I enjoy creating innovative real-time 3D and AI applications - and occasionally building tools that make life easier!
