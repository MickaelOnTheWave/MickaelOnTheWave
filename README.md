# Hi there, I'm Micka√´l! üëã

**Senior C++/Qt Developer | Expert in 3D Development & Legacy Code Modernization**

I'm a passionate developer with 19 years of international experience building complex, cross-platform desktop applications. My core expertise lies in modern C++, the Qt framework, and OpenGL for 3D rendering. I enjoy tackling large-scale challenges, from modernizing legacy systems with millions of lines of code to creating innovative real-time 3D and AI applications.
